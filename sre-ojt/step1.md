**Part 1. Kubernetes**
Applications in the cluster are failing to start. Troubleshoot and restore all pods to a Running state.
- sre-test-01: Pod terminates immediately after startup.
- sre-test-02: Pod restarts continuously. 
- sre-test-03: Pod is stuck in pending state. 
- sre-test-04: Pod enters error state. 
- sre-test-05: Failed to pull image. (ImagePullBackOff)
- sre-test-06: Pod cannot find a schedulable node. (Pending)

**Part 2. Linux**
Resolve the following issues in /root/linux-quiz.
- Script ./start_app.sh fails to execute. Fix permissions to make it executable.
- System CPU usage is abnormally high. Identify the culprit process and terminate it.
- /var partition is running out of space. Locate and delete the unnecessary large file consuming disk space.


Upon completion, please email me the root cause and solution for each issue. Also, run the "history", "kubectl get pod"command and attach a screenshot of your terminal session.
